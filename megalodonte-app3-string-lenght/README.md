## Running

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## JavaFX Modules Setup

Running via `./gradlew run` requires the JavaFX SDK modules to be available locally,
pointed to by the `JAVAFX_MODULES_HOME` environment variable (see the `run` task in
`build.gradle.kts`).

1. Download the modules archive:
   https://github.com/eliezer-dev-software-enginner/megalodonte-base/releases/download/utilities/java_fx_modules.zip
2. Extract it somewhere on disk. The extracted folder must contain `linux-25.0.1/`
   and `windows-25.0.1/` subfolders.
3. Point `JAVAFX_MODULES_HOME` at that folder:

**Windows** (PowerShell — persists across sessions):
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JAVAFX_MODULES_HOME", "C:\path\to\java_fx_modules", "User")
```
Restart your terminal/IDE afterwards so the new value is picked up.

**Linux** (bash/zsh — add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
```bash
export JAVAFX_MODULES_HOME="/path/to/java_fx_modules"
```
Restart your terminal (or run `source ~/.bashrc`) and any IDE that reads environment
variables from a login shell.

## Packaging

Packaging with the updater (does not modify the original scripts):
```bash
python scripts/create-msi-with-updater.py   # Windows
python scripts/create-deb-with-updater.py   # Linux
```

## Hot Reload

### Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install watchdog
```

### Usage

```bash
.venv/bin/python dev.py
```

Or activate the venv first:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python dev.py
```

### How it works

1. Watches `src/main/java/` for changes via `watchdog`.
2. On change, compiles the modified `.java` files with `javac`.
3. Copies modified resources to `build/classes/java/main/`.
4. Reloads the screen in JavaFX via `Reloader`.

## FAQ

**Q: I set `fontSize`/color/etc. on a component's props but nothing changes on screen. Why?**

A: Every `Props.apply(node)` call (in `megalodonte-base`) only applies styling once a
theme is set — it subscribes to `ThemeManager.state()` and silently skips applying
anything while that's `null`. Make sure `ThemeManager.setTheme(...)` is called once,
early in `main()`, before any screen renders (see `Main.java`).

**Q: `./gradlew run` fails with "Environment variable JAVAFX_MODULES_HOME is not set", but I did set it. What's going on?**

A: Two common causes:
- The variable was exported in your shell *after* the Gradle daemon (or your IDE's
  background JVM) started, so that process never inherited it. Restart your terminal
  and/or run `./gradlew --stop` to kill the stale daemon, then try again.
- You set it in a terminal, but you're launching the IDE from a desktop icon instead
  of that terminal — desktop launchers usually don't source `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc`,
  so IDE-spawned processes won't see it either. Set it via your desktop environment's
  system-wide environment variables instead, or always launch the IDE from a shell
  that has it exported.

**Q: Where do I get the JavaFX modules?**

A: See [JavaFX Modules Setup](#javafx-modules-setup) above.

**Q: How do I get live-reload while developing instead of restarting the app on every change?**

A: See [Hot Reload](#hot-reload) above — run `python dev.py` after installing `watchdog`.

**Q: How do I produce an installer for Windows/Linux?**

A: See [Packaging](#packaging) above.
